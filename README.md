# Description

This mod enhances your gaming experience with several quality-of-life improvements:
- **Button Fades**: Adds a smooth fade effect to buttons, making the UI more visually appealing.
- **Higher FPS Limit (up to 360 FPS)**: Removes the default FPS cap and allows the game to run up to 360 frames per second, ensuring a smoother experience for those with high-refresh-rate monitors.
- **Enhances Icons**: Each drug type has a different color and icon. (in the future I want to make it customizable)
- **Always Show Contract Distance**: Displays the distance to your contract permanently on the compass for better navigation.
- **Fast Stack Tweak**: Adds Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to increment or decrement stack counts by 5 per scroll step. In the future I plan to add it where you can also do Ctrl + Shift + Right-Click to quick move 5 from the stack.
