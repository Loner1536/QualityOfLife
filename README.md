## Features

### Camera Tilt for Movement
- Dynamic camera tilt based on movement input:
  - `A` / `D`: Left / Right tilt
  - `W` / `S`: Forward / Backward tilt
- Adds immersive feedback during player movement.
- **Credit**: This feature was inspired by and adapted from work by [savvvvvvvv](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/savvvvvvvv?gameId=7381) on Nexus Mods.

### Button Fade Effects
- Smooth fade-in/out animations on UI buttons for a cleaner, more modern interface.

### Increased FPS Limit
- Removes the default FPS cap, allowing up to **360 FPS** for smoother visuals on high-refresh-rate displays.

### Enhanced Contracts / Deals
- **Always Show Contract Distance**: The compass always displays the distance to your active contract — no need to aim at it.
- **Enhanced Drug Icons**: Each drug type has a unique icon and color for faster identification.
  *(Future update may allow for full customization.)*

### Fast Stack Tweak
- `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel`: Adds or removes **5** items from a stack per scroll.
